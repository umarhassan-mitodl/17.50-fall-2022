## Topic 1:  State and government

- Introductions (who you are and what you want to get out of the class)
- Pop quiz
- Overview of readings for next week
- No recitation this week
- By session 2:
    - Read this syllabus thoroughly.
    - Take the pop quiz. Read through the whole quiz before attempting any of the answers. Then spend 60 minutes to answer some of them, dividing your time however you please across questions. (You may wish to take a deep dive into one particular question or, alternatively, to answer several questions at a superficial level.) Please discuss the pop quiz with as many people as you want. You can also consult any sources you wish, but if you do, make sure to cite them properly in your posts. Post your replies on the class website. there is a separate thread for each question on the pop quiz.
    - Comment on pop quiz answers (~30 minutes). Pick one question, read through the answers already posted, and then post your own commentary.

If you are a citizen of a country without absentee balloting, you should write a short email to an official from your country inquiring into the rationale for the lack of absentee balloting, and forwarding the message to the TA afterwards. If you are from a country where elections are meaningless or where writing a government official with such a query might get you into trouble, or if you have some other principled objection to registering to vote, talk with the TA or me about how to fulfill this assignment in a way that takes a similar amount of time.
